          Each person who decides to move must have different reasons. I grew up with people around me who were born and raised in the same city, but the thought of having to live in one country for the rest of my life felt boring. So, I felt like I had a life where I was living only for travel. Humans are essentially a migrating species and have a stronger migration instinct than any other mammal on Earth. The study of early human migration through DNA testing is said to be like an incredibly intricately intertwined traffic map.<a href="#footnote-65" class="footnote-link">a 65</a> I can use the example of the Yaghan people who traveled the furthest in human history. Also the Haplogroups which are specific mitochondrial DNA gene patterns,<a href="#footnote-66" class="footnote-link">a 66</a> were studied in the 1980s and 1990s by major scientists Allan Charles Wilson, Mark Stoneking, and Rebecca L. Cann as part of haplotype research. Haplogroups refers to a group of people who share similar genetic patterns. This allows us to track how our ancestors moved.<a href="#footnote-67" class="footnote-link">a 67</a> Having residences and nationalities is considered to be a human condition,<a href="#footnote-68" class="footnote-link">a 68</a> but I think the opposite is true in some ways. Humanity has migrated in an almost unprecedented number.<a href="#footnote-69" class="footnote-link">a 69</a> This may be to force individuals to have a fixed identity in the middle of the current rising problems such as the existential crisis, nationalism, etc.<a href="#footnote-70" class="footnote-link">a 70</a> Is it possible to have a Nomad identity that doesn’t belong anywhere and continues to migrate and live? Modern nomads are concepts altered from nomads of the past. Early Nomads who didn’t rely on the land simply ran away from oppression and exploitation to settle down and make a living.<a href="#footnote-71" class="footnote-link">a 71</a> However, Current Nomads are a variant of the idea of nomads in the past. They are mainly people who can travel to different places and perform their duties through mobile technology, which is for a certain class. This also requires a visa.<a href="#footnote-72" class="footnote-link">a 72</a> A long-term relocation hard to be arbitrary anymore.

          Born in a relatively decent time, I have had the opportunity to travel with little worry. However, until just 36 years ago, in 1989, when overseas travel was fully liberalized in Korea, my parents could not get a passport for a simple overseas trip due to the country's poor economic situation at the time.<a href="#footnote-73" class="footnote-link">a 73</a> Now, thinking about it, it seems unimaginable. It’s quite sad to realize that individual needs were always constrained by the boundaries of the state.<a href="#footnote-74" class="footnote-link">a 74</a> And so far, this is still the case. I also thought that growing up in cease-fire country, this could be deprived at any time. Ironically, in a modern society where everything is unstable, the state doesn't seem to represent or guarantee 100% of any individual's safety and protection.<a href="#footnote-75" class="footnote-link">a 75</a> I came to believe that innocent civilians are always sacrificed within the framework of the state, especially when considering war and political movements. Conflicts between countries have changed the air routes that people around the world should share and this makes us re-examine the possibility of our movement itself.<a href="#footnote-76" class="footnote-link">a 76</a> Perhaps, as discussed in Chapter 1, the ruling powers may be attempting to prevent us from being able to physically move.<a href="#footnote-77" class="footnote-link">a 77</a>
