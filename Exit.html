          <p class="yes-indent"> Conclusion</p>
          This thesis attempts to provide a study of decision-making power and the evolution of boundaries for human movement and data mobility. Borders, digital control, and migration have become subjects of conflict due to the global economic recession and intensifying nationalism. Individual identity and social and racial power still exist rather than substantial changes.  Now, digital systems are entrusted with human behavior and cover up discriminatory structures and conflicts in increasingly invisible ways, which seem to be used for public goods, but eventually become a tool to strengthen the concentration of power in the state and large corporations. In conclusion, monopoly and centralization reinforce data feudalism across physical borders. Therefore, we must redefine the use of technology to serve the public good and expand democratic rights that guarantee fair mobility. This will also require autonomy over our digital ownership. Not only the physical movement of people but also the movement of data will lead us toward a more liberated and balanced society.
