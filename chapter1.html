          <p class="yes-indent">1.1. (Smart) Border</p>
          We live in a world of borders.English 'Border' is derived from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root bherdh- (“to cut” or “divide”), often cited as the ultimate root, reflecting the idea of dividing or marking territory.<a href="#footnote-1" class="footnote-link">a 1</a> In the 21st century, hundreds of new borders have been created around the world in contrast to the celebration of globalization and the increasing demand for global mobility. Modern borders are not just physical walls or fences.<a href="#footnote-2" class="footnote-link">a 2</a> The most powerful borders are ‘imperceptible’ means of control, such as data borders. The data border can also be referred to as a smart border in other words. The goal of the ‘smart’ border is not to manage the border in a humanistic way but to track and block movement in real time with high-tech surveillance systems.<a href="#footnote-3" class="footnote-link">a 3</a> The side effects of this increase the mortality rate of border crossers and exacerbate social inequality. In the United States, there were people who lost their lives trying to avoid the police when the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882) was passed.
          <a href="#footnote-4" class="footnote-link">a 4</a> It is created by people and intensifies extremism by strengthening exclusive nationalism. Border changes accumulate, and they become apparent when they cross the bifurcation.  <a href="#footnote-5" class="footnote-link">a 5</a> After events such as 9/11, COVID-19 immigration restrictions and the Schengen Agreement are a process of reinforcing and coordinating circulation. Anyone can be deported by changing inclusion and exclusion at any time.<a href="#footnote-6" class="footnote-link">a 6</a>

          Borders, as well as airports, are testbeds. Function as the first places where innovations in security systems, legislative exceptions, and supranational authority are tested and introduced, representing the early stages of change that will spread to cities, countries, and the world.<a href="#footnote-14" class="footnote-link">a 14</a> While these advanced technologies and strict regulations ensure efficient flow and safety, they also impose limits on travelers. Since the 2010s, Arrival/Departure cards have been gradually replaced by electronic systems or automated procedures. In the past, paper departure/entry cards were processed one-time without digital records and allowed entry and exit.<a href="#footnote-15" class="footnote-link">a 15</a>

        Hito Steyerl’s works reflect the political and social situation and explore the problem of constraints. How Not to Be Seen: A Fucking Didactic Educational.MOV File (2013) paradoxically shows that in a world where all our private and public data are collected semi-forced, we are intertwined with the data of our society and the spread of visual surveillance.<a href="#footnote-33" class="footnote-link">a 33</a> This eventually suggests that even if people cross physical borders in special free economic/trade zones, such as airports, they are still othered and trapped inside borders in a different way than goods. People have used sophisticated methods to cross borders in various forms. The way people are hidden in goods has tended to increase more noticeably as data surveillance becomes more advanced.<a href="#footnote-34" class="footnote-link">a 34</a> Will attempts to avoid data tracking also become more invisible and secretive?

      Airports also function as special environments where people must deviate from everyday norms or relationships for a while and follow new rules.<a href="#footnote-35" class="footnote-link">a 35</a> In French anthropologist Marc Augé’s book, An Introduction to Early Modern Anthropology (1995), he contrasts ‘place’ with ‘non-place’ and defines airports as typical ‘non-places’. According to him, it exists as spaces that lack identity.<a href="#footnote-36" class="footnote-link">a 36</a> The airport continuously collects and records specific information to turn users into ‘passengers’ roles. In this process, they are treated as ‘movers’, so individual civil rights and protection can be limited by the efficiency of the system. However, not all passengers are treated equally in this process. We are divided into mobility qualifications according to citizenship and socioeconomic status, some pass through simple screening, and others experience more processes.<a href="#footnote-37" class="footnote-link">a 37</a> Due to these differences in data reading procedures, people of the global LGBTQIA+ communities, stateless,<a href="#footnote-38" class="footnote-link">a 38</a> and undocumented immigrants can be simply identified as binary data, resulting in more marginalization.<a href="#footnote-39" class="footnote-link">a 39</a> This is a prime example of the dynamics of power operating within the space of an airport.<a href="#footnote-40" class="footnote-link">a 40</a>
